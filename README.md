# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my work for Advent of Code 2021. Advent of Code is an online event of 25 programming puzzles that helps people hone their problem-solving skills.

All the code is written in Java and problem descriptions can be found here:

My approaches and overall thought process to each of this season's problems are documented in the source code. Future improvements are called out as well.
