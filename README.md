# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my work for Advent of Code 2021. Advent of Code is an online event of 25 programming puzzles that helps people hone their problem-solving skills. There are 25 problems, each containing two parts (except for Day 25 which only contains one part).

All the code is written in Java. Each Java file contains the solutions for both parts of the problem. Part 1 runs the function `part1` and Part 2 runs the function `part2`. Even if Part 2 happens to build upon the solution for Part 1, both functions remain separate so that the Part 1 solution can stand on its own.

Problem descriptions can be found here:

My approaches and overall thought process to each of this season's problems are documented in the source code. Future improvements are called out as well.
